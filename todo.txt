Rapid Sublime v.1.0 TODO:
------------------------
Must have:
- esc shuts down server output view
- shutting down server output view shuts down the group
- rapid.exe path is parsed from grimrock.sublime_proj file
- F4 inside a function ignores empty lines
- Load st packages from custom location? (google) -> seems to not to be possible
- Key bindings etc. to preferences -> package settings -> Rapid

Nice to have:
- F4 unfolding leaves empty row between functions (if surrounding functions are folded)
- Colors in "Server Output Window"
- Mouse folding to work like F4
- Lua snippets

v.2.0 stuff
-----------
- Autocomplete method variables
- better help with F1 
- debugger?

DONE:
-----
- Highlight trace row when double clicking (done: underline)
- Stack trace traveling
- "Fold all" folds functions in a more compact space
- "Fold all" folds only blocks which start with "function()" 
- "Server Output Window" opens always in group 2
- Remove empty line from Server Output Window
- When looking an open file, check all Sublime windows, not just active one (in all cases)
- F1 (show methods)
- F4 breaks if no "end" (0 indent line) is found
- hlsl syntax highlighting (hlsl package works after closing and starting ST3)
- Stacktrace: try to find files from all folders (in all windows)
- Check project start file from all folders (in all windows) [if multiple project files are in project, the first is used ]
