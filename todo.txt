Rapid Sublime v.1.0 TODO:
------------------------
Must have:
- esc shuts down server output view (use context?)
- shutting down server output view shuts down the group

Nice to have:
- open server output view in a console, not in a view
- alt+c does not work in search (use contexts?)
- grimrock.sublime_proj to use json
	- rapid.exe path is parsed from grimrock.sublime_proj file
- Colors in "Server Output Window"
- Mouse folding to work like alt+f
- Lua snippets
- alt+f inside a function ignores empty lines 

v.2.0 stuff
-----------
- Autocomplete method variables
- better help with F1 
- debugger?

Fixed between pre-alpha and 0.0.4:
---------------------------------
- Highlight trace row when double clicking (done: underline)
- Stack trace traveling
- "Fold all" folds functions in a more compact space
- "Fold all" folds only blocks which start with "function()" 
- "Server Output Window" opens always in group 2
- Remove empty line from Server Output Window
- When looking an open file, check all Sublime windows, not just active one (in all cases)
- F1 (show methods)
- fold block breaks if no "end" (0 indent line) is found
- hlsl syntax highlighting (hlsl package works after closing and starting ST3)
- Stacktrace: try to find files from all folders (in all windows)
- Check project start file from all folders (in all windows) [if multiple project files are in project, the first is used ]
- Load st packages from custom location? (google) -> seems to not to be possible
- Key bindings etc. to preferences -> package settings -> Rapid

Done in 0.0.5
----------------------
- When evaluating block, the number of the first row must be sent to server
- When evaluating block, the first line of the block is always printed to server output
- resume (ctrl + t)
- f1 connects to server if not already connected
- remove empty line between two folded functions 
- folding rules now work
- double click does not work when rapid_sublime is running
