Rapid Sublime v.1.0 TODO:
------------------------
Must have:


Nice to have:
- alt+f to work with end lines
- Lua snippets (?)
- open server output view in a console, not in a view (is it possible?)
- Mouse folding to work like alt+f (requires hacking lua.tmlanguage, is it worth it?)

v.2.0 stuff
-----------
- Autocomplete method variables
- better help with F1 
- debugger?
- Colors in "Server Output Window"?

Fixed between pre-alpha and 0.0.4:
---------------------------------
- Highlight trace row when double clicking (done: underline)
- Stack trace traveling

- "Fold all" folds functions in a more compact space
- "Fold all" folds only blocks which start with "function()" 
- "Server Output Window" opens always in group 2
- Remove empty line from Server Output Window
- When looking an open file, check all Sublime windows, not just active one (in all cases)
- F1 (show methods)
- fold block breaks if no "end" (0 indent line) is found
- hlsl syntax highlighting (hlsl package works after closing and starting ST3)
- Stacktrace: try to find files from all folders (in all windows)
- Check project start file from all folders (in all windows) [if multiple project files are in project, the first is used ]
- Load st packages from custom location? (google) -> seems to not to be possible
- Key bindings etc. to preferences -> package settings -> Rapid

Done in 0.0.5
----------------------
- When evaluating block, the number of the first row must be sent to server
- When evaluating block, the first line of the block is always printed to server output
- resume (ctrl + t)
- f1 connects to server if not already connected
- remove empty line between two folded functions 
- folding rules now work
- double click works when rapid_sublime is running

Done in 0.0.6
----------------------
- shutting down server output view shuts down the group
- alt+c works in search 
- esc shuts down server output view

Done in 0.0.7
----------------------
- Project settings are parsed from JSON file
	- Project settings file extension is *.rapid_sublime
	- Rapid.exe path is parsed from project settings file
- Component.lua:50 cursor jumps weirdly when folding a function (could not reproduce this)
- alt+e should not move focus to server output view
- esc to close only current context
- alt+f inside a function should not ignore empty lines 
- folding breaks with multiline strings (DungeonEditor.lua) (fully fixed)
	- fold all fixed
	- fold block partially fixed
	- alt+f works when cursor is on an unintented row inside a function block
- speed up block folding/unfolding (alt+f)
